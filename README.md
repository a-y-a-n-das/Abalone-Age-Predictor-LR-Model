# Abalone-Age-Predictor-LR-Model
This project focuses on predicting the age of abalones using machine-learning techniques
This project uses machine learning to predict the age of abalones based on physical measurements such as length, diameter, height, and various weight attributes. The goal is to predict the abalone's age, represented by the number of rings on its shell.

# Features:
Dataset with features like sex, length, diameter, and weight.
Linear Regression model for age prediction.
Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualizations of Predicted vs Actual Values.
